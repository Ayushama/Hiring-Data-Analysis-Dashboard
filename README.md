# Hiring Data Analysis Dashboard  

📊 **Power BI Project | Employee Hiring Insights (2014 Data)**  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes the **employee hiring data of 2014** to uncover key recruitment insights.  
Using **Power BI**, I built an interactive dashboard to track the hiring funnel, efficiency, and performance metrics.  

The goal is to help HR & management teams make data-driven decisions by understanding:  
- How many positions were opened vs. filled  
- Average time taken to hire (Time-to-Fill)  
- Hiring trends over time  
- Source of hire effectiveness  
- Funnel conversion at each hiring stage

- **Bar Chart**: Hires by Source / Business Unit / Region
